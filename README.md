I made a colorwheel for html that could help artist to get the color inspiration.
But this one is a unfinished product and it have a lot of bug .The biggest one is the color-points couldn't matching the color from colorwheel.
My ability is limited.if I learn something about this that maybe I will repair it,but isn't now.
